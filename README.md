### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Justin Stewart, and I'm a software developer focused on building distribute services and applications on AWS. I help developers and companies reliably scale their infrastructure and streamline their development processes by complementing the tools and services they love with the ones that fit them best on AWS.

My primary work right now revolves around data/event-driven, serverless architectures. I'm active in all areas of the backend, from the edge all the way to the data lake, building continuously delivered and deployed pipelines that enable fast iteration, safe releases, observable application state, and the creation of actionable analytics through data ingests. This has given me real hands-on experience with the best ways to combine a plethora of AWS services into architectures that are reliable, easy to change, and can scale.

Personally, I'm married and live in Tulsa, OK with my wife and our two dogs. I'm a gamer (anything by Sid Meier, FromSoftware, or Klei), love dog training through positive reinforcement, and am a gardener that is trying not to let his plants die. I also occasionally motivate myself toward fitness.
